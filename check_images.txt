1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
Yes, all three models classified the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg as "german shepherd, german shepherd dog, german police dog, alsatian." There are no differences in the classifications for this image.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes
Dog_01.jpg: Classified as "german shepherd, german shepherd dog, german police dog, alsatian" by all three models.
Dog_02.jpg: Classified as "boxer" by all three models.



3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: : Yes, all three models correctly classified:

Ginger-cat_01.jpg as not a dog (classified as "tiger cat, cat").
Coffee_mug_01.jpg as not a dog (classified as "pitcher, ewer").
There were no misclassifications for these images.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:All three models performed similarly, achieving:

Pct Correct Dogs: 100%
Pct Correct Not Dogs: 100%
Pct Match: 50%
Given the identical performance metrics and classifications across all models, no single model stands out as the best in this scenario. However, they all consistently identified non-dog images correctly, which is a crucial aspect of classification.
